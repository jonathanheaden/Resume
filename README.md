## About me
I love tech! I take every opportunity to incorporate the latest tech into my personal life. I like to stay up to date by listening to podcasts, reading and studying. 
I see Cloud as an opportunity to enhance our collective productivity.

## Reference work
### Shopify app 
My wife sells products [online](https://pileaplace.com). She hosts her store on [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com.au/).

She could not find a suitable solution to calculate accurate shipping costs for Australia. She required the ability to calculate shipping using the AusPost API & to control which products could be ordered from which Australian States, and which products could not be dispatched to international destinations.

I wrote a custom node JS app which I host on digitalocean to suit her needs. The backend is written in nodeJS, the frontend in VueJS and it uses Json Web Tokens for single signon. The code is in a private BitBucket repository. It is embedded in the Shopify admin console as a SaaS for merchants. Below url is a static front page to explain what the app does
